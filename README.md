# bmvc16_face
# Introduction

This repository contains code to reproduce the face rotation experiments in [Towards Automatic Image Editing: Learning to See another You](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~xjia/xjia_publications/xjia_bmvc16_facefinal.pdf), a BMVC 2016 paper by Amir Ghodrati\*, Xu Jia\*, Marco Pedersoli, Tinne Tuytelaars (\* Amir and Xu contributed equally).

We propose a method that aims at automatically editing an image by altering its attributes. More specifically, given an image of a certain class (e.g. a human face), the method should generate a new image as similar as possible to the given one, but with an altered visual attribute (e.g. the same face with a new pose or a different illumination).

If you use our code in your research, please cite following paper:
